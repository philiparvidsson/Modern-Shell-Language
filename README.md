# Modern Shell Language <img align="right" src="img/mshl-logo.png">

**mshl** is a language for performing automated shell tasks. It's similar to JavaScript in its syntax and compiles to Windows batch files (a bash target is planned!). This gives you the freedom of modern syntax and language functionality, allowing you to write much more complex programs that run on Windows and Linux **without requiring the end user to install any extra piece of software**.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisities

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Stay what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Run the tests by executing `python runtests.py` in the `src`directory. All tests in the `tests` directory will be built and run automatically, ending with a report of passing and failing tests, as well as how much time it took to run them.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
