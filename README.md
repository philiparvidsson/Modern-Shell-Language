# Modern Shell Language <img align="right" src="img/mshl-logo.png">

**mshl** is a language for performing automated shell tasks. It's similar to JavaScript in its [syntax](doc/syntax.md) and compiles to Windows batch files (a bash target is planned!). This gives you the freedom of modern syntax and language functionality, allowing you to write much more complex programs that run on Windows and Linux **without requiring the end user to install any extra piece of software**.

## Getting Started

1. Download and install [Python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Write a program in mshl or download one of the [examples](examples).
3. Compile the program with mshlc by invoking it with Python (make sure you are in the correct directory first!): `python mshlc filename.js`

Depending on your platform, you will have a file named `<filename>.bat` in your current directory. It is the compiled shell script, ready to be deployed and executed on any system. The system that you deploy the program on will **not require any software installation**â€”a mere copy of the compiled script file is required.

### Prerequisities

* [Python 2.7.x](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
  * mshl requires Python to be able to run.

```
mshl requires Python to be able to run.
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Begin by downloading and installing [Python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

```
On Linux, depending on your distribution, Python comes pre-installed. This means
that you do not need to install anything for mshl to work. If you don't have
Python (you can check by typing python in a terminal), you might be able to
install it by typing sudo apt-get install python.
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the Tests

Run the tests by executing `python runtests.py` in the `src`directory. All tests in the `tests` directory will be built and run automatically, ending with a report of passing and failing tests, as well as how much time it took to run them.

## Deployment

### Deploying the compiler

Deploying the mshl compiler is a matter of downloading the mshl binary. The compiler is then invoked with Python by typing `python mshlc <srcfile>`, which will generate a shell script for the target platform.

### Deploying compiled programs

Programs compiled with mshlc are shell scripts that run on their target platforms without requiring the installation of any software. Simply transfer the compiled script to the target system and run it!

## Built With

* emacs - The best text editor out there! ;-)
* Python - A widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.
